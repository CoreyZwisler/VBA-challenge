I separated my code into 2 different loops because my computer would crash if I did it in one loop.
Another thing I noticed was sometimes the code wouldn't show all of the results of the code in the stock data, but would work fine on the smaller data sheet we were given for testing.
I am unsure if this is due to the limitations of my computer since the code didn't change.
